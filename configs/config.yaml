prompts:
  plan_1: >
    You are a 10x Staff Engineer.
    Vulnerable Code:
    ```python
    {vulnerable_code}
    ```
    Your task is to brainstorm 3 distinct strategies to fix this
    vulnerability. Focus on maintainability, readability, and performance.

  plan_2: >
    You are a 10x Staff Engineer.
    Vulnerable Code:
    ```python
    {vulnerable_code}
    ```
    Context:
    {strategy_analysis_text}

    Select the *best* strategy. Now, generate *only* the full, complete,
    and syntactically correct Python code for the patch.
    
    *** IMPORTANT ***
    The code must be a complete, valid Python file.
    Do NOT add a 'package' or 'module' declaration.

  prompt_plan_3_retry: >
    You are a 10x Staff Engineer debugging a failed patch.
    Your previous attempt was incorrect and failed validation.

    Here is the original vulnerable Python code:
    ```python
    {vulnerable_code}
    ```

    Here is the patch you generated, which FAILED:
    ```python
    {failed_patch}
    ```

    Here is the **pristine Python stack trace** from the test harness.
    This error was caused by YOUR failed patch.
    ```
    {error_message}
    ```

    Your task is to respond in three parts:
    1.  In a `<thinking>` block, analyze the stack trace.
    2.  In a `<plan>` block, describe your new strategy.
    3.  In a `<patch>` block, provide *only* the full, complete,
       and syntactically correct Python code for the new patch.
